            <h2>1. Problem Understanding and Overview</h2>
            <h3>Problem Summary</h3>
            <p>The company’s current data storage setup cannot meet growing data volume and complexity requirements. Key issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited scalability</li>
                <li>Inefficient workflows</li>
                <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Challenges in maintaining regulatory compliance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These challenges hinder operational efficiency and affect the company's ability to adapt to data-driven business demands.</p>

            <h3>Business Goals</h3>
            <p>To overcome these challenges, the company seeks a scalable, secure, and efficient data storage solution on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Goals include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing data accessibility</li>
                <li>Ensuring compliance</li>
                <li>Improving security</li>
                <li>Streamlining integration and migration processes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve data retrieval and accessibility.</li>
                <li>Increase scalability to support data growth.</li>
                <li>Strengthen data security and regulatory compliance.</li>
                <li>Facilitate smooth integration and migration to OCI.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Proposed Solution -->
        <section id="solution">
            <h2>2. Proposed Solution</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Solution Overview</h3>
            <p>The proposed solution leverages Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) storage options, including Object Storage, Block Storage, and File Storage, to modernize data architecture. This setup enhances accessibility, security, and scalability to handle increased data volumes efficiently.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Step-by-Step Approach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Assess Current Architecture:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive evaluation to identify storage gaps and map needs to OCI storage types.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop a Migration Plan:</strong> Design a phased migration approach to move data to OCI without disrupting operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement Security and Compliance Controls:</strong> Set up OCI’s data encryption, access control, and compliance monitoring tools to protect sensitive data and meet standards like GDPR and HIPAA.</li>
                <li><strong>Configure Backup and Disaster Recovery:</strong> Establish automatic backups and disaster recovery solutions within OCI to ensure data resilience.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2.3 Data and Input Sources</h3>
            <p>The data includes transactional records, customer data, logs, and analytics information. This data will be categorized and stored within OCI for optimized retrieval and secure access. Encryption and access control measures will secure all stored data.</p>
